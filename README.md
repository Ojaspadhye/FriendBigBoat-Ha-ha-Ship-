💥💥💥💥I dont know how will i complete it💥💥💥💥

This is to make a small project. This is to lern django, django-restframework, backend.
I have initially used AI but will try to not use it. Over time I will not use it at all.
This is the first good project i will be pushing.

This web application will include:
  1. Making Friends
  2. Making clans (Like Discord)
  3. ChatRooms, GroupCalls
  4. Small Games And fun Rooms (I am going to make them my self using Godot Game Engine)
  5. Game Stand (This will be like hosting games like football match cricket match and kind of brodcast it) (Not using zoom, or anything like that) (Going to use webrtc)

I am actully shit at coding. And Probably i will get better at the end of this project.
If you can help by making changes suggesting changes. I will be glad.

I dont know how will i complete it or how will i host it. But i am super pumped.
So much fucking Pumped


💥💥💥💥Fuck yes This will be a banger💥💥💥💥
